description:
%%name%% combines `dos2ansi` with a terminal emulator (by default `xterm`) and
a pager (by default `less`) to form an ANSI-art viewer. It uses SAUCE metadata
obtained from `dos2ansi` to select an appropriate font, set the terminal
window size and the window title.

Even if SAUCE metadata is absent, it tries to guess the appropriate font from
rendering metadata. If the final display size is exactly 80x50 or 80x43, the
file is assumed to target the respective VGA or EGA mode, so a wide font is
selected. If the input uses ANSI.SYS sequences for setting a textmode, the
font selection takes into account whether an 80- or 40-column mode is
selected.

%%name%% always prefers the number of columns and rows given on the
commandline for the terminal window size. For everything else, to override
it from the commandline, the `-S` flag must be given if contradicting SAUCE
metadata is available.
.
defgroup: 2

[flag S]
description:
Ignore SAUCE and other metadata and use all defaults or values passed on the
commandline.

Also passes ignoring SAUCE to `dos2ansi`.
.

[flag V]
group: 0
optional: 0
description: Print version information and exit.

[flag c columns]
description:
The number of columns for display, IOW, the width of the terminal window.

Also passed to `dos2ansi` as the default canvas width (flag `-w`).
.

[flag d dos2ansi]
description:
Run %%arg%% to render the input file for the configured pager to display.
.
default: `%%DOS2ANSI%%`

[flag e]
description:
Use an EGA font. This is ignored if the font type can be deduced from SAUCE
metadata unless `-S` is given.
.
default: from metadata or VGA

[flag h]
group: 1
optional: 0
description: Print a help text and exit.

[flag n]
description:
No letter spacing, which means to pick an 8px wide font. This is ignored
if spacing information is available from SAUCE unless `-S` is given.
.
default: from metadata or spaced (9px)

[flag r rows]
description:
The number of rows for display, IOW, the height of the terminal window.
.

[flag s]
description:
Assume square pixels, so, pick a font without aspect correction. This is
ignored if aspect information is available from SAUCE unless `-S` is given.
.
default: from metadata or rectangular pixels

[flag w]
description:
Use a wide font (for 40-columns or VGA50 or EGA43 modes), which means a
9x8/8x8 or 18x16/16x16 font. This is ignored if the font type can be deduced
from SAUCE metadata unless `-S` is given.
.
default: from metadata or regular width

[flag -]

[arg args]
description:
Arguments for `dos2ansi`, including the file to display. Must be preceded by
`--` if it contains flags (starting with `-`). If it doesn't contain a file
to display, the standard input will be read and fed to `dos2ansi`.
.

[file %%SYSCONFDIR%%/showansirc]
description:
The main configuration file. This is used to configure the terminal emulator,
including necessary command line arguments, the pager, and the fontset.

Paths to per-user configuration files can be set here as well.
.

[file %%SYSCONFDIR%%/showansirc.sample]
description:
A commented example configuration file, demonstrating all the available
options.
.

[file %%FONTSDIR%%/fonts.bitmap]
description:
A fontset for `xterm` using bitmap fonts from
<https://github.com/farsil/ibmfonts>
.

[file %%FONTSDIR%%/fonts.scalable]
description:
A fontset for `xterm` using scalable fonts from
<https://int10h.org/oldschool-pc-fonts>
.

[file %%FONTSDIR%%/fonts.mixed]
description:
A fontset combining both sets above, using scalable fonts when aspect
correction for non-square pixels is wanted, bitmap fonts otherwise. This is
the default fontset in the example configuration.
.

[var SHOWANSI_DEBUG]
description:
When this is set to `1`, %%name%% prints some debugging information to the
standard output, including the full command line it will execute to display
the input file.
.

[var TMPDIR]
description:
%%name%% needs to process an input file multiple times with `dos2ansi` to get
metadata and then render it in a terminal configured appropriately, so when
input comes from standard input, it must be stored in a temporary file. A
private directory will be created for that purpose, using `mktemp` if
available, otherwise using plain `mkdir` below %%var%%. Note that `mktemp`
typically also uses %%var%%. If unset, it defaults to `/tmp`.
