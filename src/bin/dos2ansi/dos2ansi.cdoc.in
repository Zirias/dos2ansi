description:
%%name%% converts MS-DOS text files using ANSI.SYS escape sequences to a
format a modern terminal can display. The output will use a Unicode encoding
of characters and only ANSI SGR escape sequences to set basic foreground and
background colors, intensity and blinking attribute. The input is expected to
use `CP-437` or one of the other supported DOS codepages.

The builtin translation tables attempt to match the appearance on VGA as close
as possible by mapping to Unicode characters looking similar to the original
IBM PC glyphs in most fonts. This behavior can be disabled with the `-X` flag,
which is helpful when %%name%% is used to convert some text or when using
original IBM PC fonts for display.

defgroup: 2

[flag A]
description:
Assume full support for ANSI SGR sequences including clearing individual
attributes. This gives the shortest possible output in most cases, but might
not work correctly with some terminals. Implies forcing generic ANSI output
(`-a`).
.

[flag B]
description: Disable writing a BOM.
default: BOM enabled for `UTF-16` and `UTF-16LE`.

[flag C]
description: Disable colors in output.

[flag E]
description: Ignore the DOS EOF character (`0x1a`) and just continue reading.

[flag H scrheight]
description:

Set a default screen height. This is relevant when ANSI.SYS sequences for
cursor positioning or erasing are used.

Ignored if the height can be deduced from SAUCE metadata or mode-setting
ANSI.SYS sequences.
.

[flag I]
description:
When using generic ANSI output, don't attempt to explicitly select intense
colors but rely on the bold attribute for the foreground color instead. For
background colors, see `-k` and `-v`.
.

[flag P]
description: Force using a normal pipe bar symbol.
default:

Replace with a broken bar for codepages not having an explicit broken bar.
.

[flag R]
description: Use line endings without `CR` (Unix format).
default: Disabled on Windows, enabled otherwise.

[flag S]
description:
Don't attempt to read SAUCE metadata. This enables setting options that are
otherwise ignored when values are found in SAUCE, like the width, whether to
use blink or bright colors, and the codepage.
.

[flag T]
description:
Test mode, instead of reading an input file, use some builtin test input that
will render a codepage table and a display of all foreground and background
colors.
.

[flag V]
group: 0
optional: 0
description:
Print version information along with some build-time and OS-dependent
configuration settings and exit.
.

[flag W]
description:
When showing SAUCE (`-s`), don't attempt to re-wrap the comment but show it as
is instead.
.

[flag X]
description:
Disable the mapping to Unicode codepoints that look more similar to the
original VGA font in most fonts used nowadays, instead map to codepoints
identifying the same character. Use this when using some actual IBM-PC font
for display.
.

[flag a]
description:
Force using the generic ANSI color writer, which defaults to use 16 explicit
colors, but can be configured for just 8 colors as well as 256 colors.

When %%name%% is built with curses support (non-Windows), it uses a
terminfo-based writer by default, even when output goes to a file, possibly
creating terminal-specific output.

On Windows 10 and later, the terminal supports 256 colors which is used by
default for output to the console, but can be disabled using this flag. On
older Windows versions, only the legacy Windows Console API can be used for
display, so this flag does nothing.
.

[flag b]
description: Force writing a BOM.
default: BOM enabled for `UTF-16` and `UTF-16LE`.

[flag c codepage]
description:
The MS-DOS codepage used by the input file. May be prefixed with `CP` (any
casing) and an optional space or dash. When the codepage can be found in
SAUCE metadata, this flag is ignored.
- [supported:]: `437`, `708`, `720`, `737`, `775`, `819`, `850`, `852`, `855`,
  `857`, `860`, `861`, `862`, `863`, `864`, `865`, `869`, `kam`, `maz`, `mik`
- [aliases:]:
  | `858`               | => `850` with Euro (`-e`) |
  | `872`               | => `855` with Euro (`-e`) |
  | `867`, `895`        | => `kam`                  |
  | `667`, `790`, `991` | => `maz`                  |
  | `866`               | => `mik`                  |
.

default: `437`

[flag d]
description: Use default terminal colors for VGA's gray on black.
default: Explicitly select these colors.

[flag e]
description:
Use codepage variations with an Euro currency symbol if applicable. For
codepages `850`, `857`, `864` and `869`, there are specific known places for
the Euro symbols. For other codepages that have a generic currency symbol,
replace this with the Euro currency symbol.
.

[flag h]
group: 1
optional: 0
description: Print a help text and exit.

[flag k]
description:
Use blink attribute for intense background colors. This flag is ignored if
SAUCE metadata is available.

Note that blink only works in some terminals. In any case, bright background
colors will be disabled.
.

[flag l]
description:
Attempt to enforce left-to-right writing direction by wrapping the output in
a Unicode LTR override region.
.

[flag m]
description:
Write some metadata to stderr while rendering. The output format is
`key=value`, this can be used from scripts or for debugging purposes.
.

[flag o outfile]
description:
Write output to %%arg%%. If not given, output is written to the standard
output.
.

[flag p]
description:
Force replacing the pipe bar with a broken bar better matching the appearance
of most VGA fonts.
.

default: Only replace when the codepage does not have an explicit broken bar.

[flag q saucequery]
description:
Query individual SAUCE metadata fields in a machine-readable format. Each
field is requested by a single character in %%arg%% and printed on a single
line to the standard output, converted from `CP-437` to `UTF-8`.

The following characters are supported in %%arg%%:
- [`:`]: toggle quoting all subsequent fields in single quotes, with literal
  single quotes translated to `'\''` (POSIX shell style)
- [`T`]: title
- [`A`]: author
- [`G`]: group
- [`D`]: date (format: YYYYMMDD)
- [`C`]: comment, output will be multiple lines, the first line is the number
  of lines to follow
- [`t`]: file and data type
- [`w`]: width (in characters)
- [`h`]: height (in characters)
- [`b`]: background mode (`0`: blink, `1`: bright)
- [`s`]: spacing (`0`: 8px, `1`: 9px)
- [`a`]: aspect ratio (`0`: rectangular pixels, `1`: square pixels)
- [`f`]: font name
- [`c`]: codepage
.

[flag r]
description: Use line endings with `CR` (DOS/Windows format).
default: Enabled on Windows, disabled otherwise.

[flag s]
description:
Show SAUCE metadata instead of actual contents. If the input file does not
have SAUCE, %%name%% will fail.
.

[flag t tabwidth]
description: Distance of tabstop positions.
min: 2
default: 8
max: screen width or 255

[flag u format]
description: Unicode output format, one of `UTF-8`, `UTF-16` or `UTF-16LE`.
default: `UTF-8`, on Windows `UTF-16LE` when output goes to a file or pipe.

[flag v]
description:
Use reverse attribute for intense background colors. With most terminals,
this will actually result in reversed colors. It's only included for exotic
terminals abusing this attribute to enable bright background colors.

Implies disabling explicit intense colors (`-I`) and conflicts with blink
(`-k`).
.

[flag w width]
description:
Width of the virtual screen. If the width is available from SAUCE metadata,
this flag is ignored.
.

min: 16
default: 80
max: 1024

[flag x]
description:
Attempt to use exact CGA/VGA colors. This requires a terminal capable of 256
colors and is used automatically when %%name%% is built with curses and an
appropriate terminal is found, or on Windows 10 and later.
.

[flag y]
description:
Use exact colors (see `-x`), but with a "dark yellow" color instead of
adjusting it to brown, resulting in a palette you would see on some CGA
machine when using a cheap monitor or a TV set.
.

[arg infile]
optional: 1
description:
Read input from %%arg%%. If not given, input is read from the standard input.
.

[var TERM]
description:
When %%name%% is built with curses support (non-Windows only), the output
by default depends on the current value of %%var%%, even when writing to
a file. This can be used to create files suitable for a specific terminal.
To produce generic ANSI output instead, see the flags `-a` and `-A`.
