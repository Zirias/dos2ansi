# ===========================================================================


# The X terminal emulator program to run
#TERMINAL=xterm

# Arguments to always pass to the X terminal emulator
# The default args will set the TERM name to xterm-256color, set default
# colors to match VGA and disable the scrollback buffer.
#TERM_ARGS="-tn xterm-256color -bg black -fg lightgray -sl 0"

# The shell to use in the X terminal emulator
# This will just be exported, terminal emulators *should* use it to execute
# the dos2ansi pipeline (xterm does) and there should rarely be a need to
# change it.
#SHELL=%%SH%%

# Arguments to always pass to dos2ansi
# The default -X disables attempting to match visuals by replacing some
# characters for others looking "most similar" to EGA/VGA in most fonts.
# We want to use "original" fonts instead.
#D2A_ARGS=-X

# Maximum width for the terminal window (in characters)
#MAXWIDTH=200

# Maximum height for the terminal window (in characters)
#MAXHEIGHT=60

# Pager to pipe dos2ansi output to
# Flags for less should contain -R to allow ANSI color sequences.
# The default allows mouse scrolling, minimizes disturbing display and
# disables the terminal bell.
#PAGER="less --mouse --wheel-lines 3 -~QRScPs"

# Number of lines to reserve for the pager
# The default of 1 matches the bottom line less always displays
#ADDLINES=1

# How to set a window title
# If this is set to '!', an escape sequence to set the terminal title is
# used instead.
#SETTITLE=!

# How to set a window geometry (<w>x<h> in characters)
# If this is set to '!', an escape sequence to set the terminal size is
# used instead.
#SETGEOM=-geometry

# How to execute a command in the terminal (instead of the interactive shell)
#EXECUTE=-e

# The set of fonts to use
# showansi will look for a file named "fonts.<FONTSET>" in these locations:
# - %%FONTSDIR%%
# - %%SYSCONFDIR%%/showansi
# - whatever USERFONTS is set to
# Each existing file will be loaded, so it's e.g. possible to just override
# a few fonts from %%FONTSDIR%%/fonts.example
# by placing a file named fonts.example in USERFONTS.
# For examples see the files installed to %%FONTSDIR%%
FONTSET=mixed

# Finally, specify where to read per-user configuration from
# *** CAUTION ***
# showansi just sources configuration files, so any shell script there will
# be executed. It will refuse to run as root, but if you're paranoid enough,
# you might still want to additionally comment these settings, which will
# disable reading any user configuration.
